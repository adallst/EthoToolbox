# Using EthoToolbox tools for the Eyelink Toolbox

## Installation

In addition to PsychToolbox, you must have the Eyelink software development kit
installed on your system from SR Research. Unfortunately this process isn't as
simple or convenient as it might be, requiring an account with the SR Research
support forum, but in just a few steps you can be ready to go.

1. Visit the [SR Research support forum](www.sr-support.com). If you don't
   already have an account, create one and log in.
2. Find the post containing the download and installation instructions for your
   operating system. At the time of writing, you should be able to find this
   either by using the forum's search feature, or by going to the "Eyelink
   Display Software" subforum of the "Downloads" section. The instructions
   should be in a sticky thread titled "EyeLink Developers Kit for (OS)", with
   available OSes being Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux.
3. Download the SDK and follow the instructions to configure it for your system.
   If everything has gone correctly, you should be able to confirm that the
   Eyelink Toolbox is now working simply by entering the command `Eyelink` at
   the Matlab/Octave prompt.
